    Probe the Stash REST API for merge status just so it recalculates the
    refspec: this just causes the plugin to send a request to the Stash
    REST API endpoint which triggers recalculation of Git refspecs.
    Unlike the "Build only if..." options, this one has no impact on
    proceeding with the build itself.<br/>

    Use this if you encounter problems with stale commits being built,
    but don't want to skip builds based on the PR status (as would be
    the case with the "Build only if Stash reports no conflicts" or
    "Build only if Stash reports PR is mergeable" options). Also note
    that this option does not have any special effect if you have
    enabled one of those two options.<br/>

    Normally Stash has a "lazy" recalculation, after a request to do so
    (which may be part of Stash Web-UI processing among other things),
    in order to avoid server load spikes whenever a source or target
    branch of a pull request changes.<br/>

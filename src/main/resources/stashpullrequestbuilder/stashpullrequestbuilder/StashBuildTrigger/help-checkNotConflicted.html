    Don't build the PR if Stash reports it to be in the <em>conflict</em>
    state. This <strong>must</strong> be used if using the <em>merge</em>
    refspec. Stash 2.9+ doesn't provide the <em>merge</em> refspec for
    conflicted PRs, so Jenkins could end up testing an older version of
    the PR.

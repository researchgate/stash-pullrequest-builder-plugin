<div>
    Build the PR if the specified phrase has been posted as a PR comment
    in Stash, even if the PR has not changed.<br/>

    The phrase should be a substring of the comment. The case is ignored.
    For instance, "Test this please, Jenkins!" would match the default
    setting.<br/>

    Default: <em>test this please</em>
